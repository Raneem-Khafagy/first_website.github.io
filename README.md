# Personal Blog Website
This project requires me to utilize my HTML and CSS skills to build out a responsive website, including custom images, layout, and styling. Along with webpage design considerations, I worked to appropriately structure the files, as well as use proper CSS and HTML formatting & style.

# languages used
- HTML
- bootstrap
- CSS 
used flexbox and css grid

This is my first website developed so it is just the beginning and i still have a long way to go.
Thanks.
