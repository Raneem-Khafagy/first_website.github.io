# Personal Blog Website
This project requires me to utilize my HTML and CSS skills to build out a responsive website, including custom images, layout, and styling. Along with webpage design considerations, I worked to appropriately structure the files, as well as use proper CSS and HTML formatting & style.

I convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This required a modification in the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.
# The functionalities:
- HTML
- bootstrap
- CSS 
used flexbox and css grid

This is my first website developed so it is just the beginning and i still have a long way to go.
Thanks.
